What are assertions, why do we care about them and what are they good for?
At its core, ```assert``` is a tool designed to help us to debug. If the assert condition is true, nothing heppens, and the program will continues to execute as normal. But if the condition evaluates to false, an ```AssertionError``` exception error is raised with an optional error message (Bader, 2017). 
```python
assert_stmt ::= "assert" expression ["," expression]
```
This is equivalent to:
```python
if __debug__:
    if not expression: raise AssertionError
``` 
Extended version:
```python
if __debug__:
    if not expression1: raise AssertionError(expression2)
```
Here is the implementation of assert:
```python
def apply_discount(product, discount):
    price = int(product['price'] * (1.0 - discount))
    assert 0 <= price <= product['price]
    return price
```
The ```assert``` statement above is to make sure and guarantee that no matter what, discounted prices calculated by this function cannot be lower than $0 and cannot be higher than the original price of the product.
