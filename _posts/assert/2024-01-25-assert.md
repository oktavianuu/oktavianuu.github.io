What are assertions, why do we care about them and what are they good for?
At its core, ```assert``` is a tool designed to help us to debug. If the assert condition is true, nothing heppens, and the program will continues to execute as normal. But if the condition evaluates to false, an ```AssertionError``` exception error is raised with an optional error message (Bader, 2017).
